# Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) with Microsoft Defender for Cloud
Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) continuously monitors cloud resources to ensure secure configurations and compliance. This proactive approach helps prevent breaches caused by misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.
[concept-cloud-security-posture-management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-cloud-security-posture-management) [What is a CNAPP? | Microsoft Security](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-cnapp#:~:text=CSPM%20solutions%20are%20designed%20to,gaps%20and%20keep%20them%20closed)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud (part of Microsoft's CNAPP suite) provides built-in CSPM tools, offering automated assessments and recommendations across Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. Using these tools aligns with modern security best practices like Zero Trust and DevSecOps.

Key Concepts

Zero Trust: A security philosophy that "assumes breach and verifies each request explicitly," enforcing continuous authentication and least-privilege access. [zero-trust-overview]([https://example.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview#:~:text=These%20principles%20are%20the%20core,never%20trust%2C%20always%20verify) In cloud security, Zero Trust means continuously validating users, devices, and connections rather than trusting any component by default.

Cloud-Native Application Protection (CNAPP): CNAPP unifies security and compliance on one platform, combining CSPM, workload protection, code (IaC) scanning, and identity management. It enables teams to embed security early in the development lifecycle and see risks across cloud and code together.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud (CSPM): Defender for Cloud continuously assesses and visualizes your security posture with a secure score, compliance benchmarks, and prioritized alerts. [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/security/business/cloud-security/microsoft-defender-cloud#tabx0e9e47597f04421aad4e22093686f81a) [Microsoft Defender Cloud Security Posture Management](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/cloud-security/microsoft-defender-cloud-security-posture-management#:~:text=Get%20agent,scanning) It scans for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities across Azure, AWS, and GCP (with agentless or agent-based methods) and guides teams on how to fix issues.

By leveraging Defender for Cloud’s CSPM capabilities and following Zero Trust/CNAPP principles, teams can maintain a strong cloud security posture. The projects aims to demonstrate how to secure data and identity and continuously remediate issues across cloud resources and code.
